# Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System(AQMS)
Breathe easy with real-time air quality monitoring

Air is an essential component of life on Earth, and it plays a vital role in supporting human health, agriculture, and the environment. In fact,An average human being requires nearly 12-15 times more air than the food. In recent years, car emissions, chemicals from factories, smoke and dust are  everywhere. That is the reason why now air condition is  much polluted. The effect of air pollution is very bad for our health. Lungs may cause some diseases, such as asthma, cough, lung disorders. The air pollution may contain a lot of dangerous substances, such as LPG gas, carbon monoxide, and methane. Substances in the polluted air are very dangerous. For example, if the carbon monoxide is above 100ppm, it makes human feel dizzy, nauseous, and within minutes they could die.

An Air quality sensor is a device that measures and detects various pollutants presents in the air. The results of an air quality sensor can provide important information about the levels of various pollutants in the air. Some common pollutants that are measured by air quality sensors include particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and others. Typically, the results of an air quality sensor are presented as numerical values or readings that indicate the concentration of each pollutant. These readings can be compared to air quality standards or guidelines set by regulatory agencies to determine if the air quality is within acceptable limits or if it may be harmful to human health and sends a notification if the levels are worse. 

Air quality sensors play an important role in ensuring the health and well-being of individuals, as well as the environment. Here are some of the key reasons why air quality sensors are significant:

1) Protecting human health: Poor air quality can have serious negative impacts on human health, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer. Air quality sensors can detect the presence of harmful pollutants in the air, enabling individuals and organizations to take steps to reduce exposure and protect their health.

2) Identifying pollution sources: Air quality sensors can help identify the sources of air pollution, such as traffic congestion, industrial emissions, or wildfire smoke. This information can be used to develop targeted interventions to reduce pollution and improve air quality.

3) Improving indoor air quality: Indoor air quality can also have a significant impact on human health, especially for individuals with respiratory conditions or allergies. Air quality sensors can monitor indoor air quality parameters such as temperature, humidity, and levels of carbon dioxide, and enable individuals to take steps to improve air quality in their homes and workplaces.

4) Supporting environmental monitoring: Air quality sensors can provide valuable information on environmental conditions, including air quality, that can be used to monitor the impact of human activities on the environment and inform policy decisions.

Overall, air quality sensors are a crucial tool for protecting human health, identifying pollution sources, improving indoor air quality, and supporting environmental monitoring. They enable individuals and organizations to make informed decisions about their environment, reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, and take action to improve air quality.
